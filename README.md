# NetTraffic

NetTraffic is an application that gives real-time statistics on network usage (download speed, currently downloaded, etc.)

Note: Incase you have installed a new network driver with WinPcap already installed, the program won't recognize it.  To fix this, reinstall winpcap.

## Requirements

1. winpcap
2. working C compiler
